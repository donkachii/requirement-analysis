# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

A requirement analysis is a phase about what a system should do, or how it should behave, in order to satisfy a need.

Think of requirements as the bridge between stakeholders (people who need the system) and developers (people who build the system).

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

	•	They prevent misunderstanding between developers and stakeholders.
	•	They save time and cost by reducing rework.
	•	They ensure the final product actually solves the problem.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

* Requirement Gathering
Collecting initial information about what stakeholders (users, clients, managers) want from the system. The goal is to capture all possible needs at a high level.

	Methods:
	* Reviewing existing documents
	* Studying current systems
	* Conducting stakeholder interviews
Example: For a food delivery app, gathering that users want to “order food online and track deliveries.”

* Requirement Elicitation
  Actively drawing out detailed requirements from stakeholders using structured techniques. The goal is deeper than just “what do you want?” to uncover the real needs and hidden expectations.
  
   Techniques:
	* Interviews and workshops
	* Surveys and questionnaires
	* Observation (shadowing users at work)
	* Brainstorming sessions
	* Prototyping (showing mock screens to spark feedback)
   Example: Asking restaurant owners: “How do you want to manage your menu and incoming orders?”

* Requirement Documentation
   Recording the requirements in a structured, clear, and unambiguous way so both stakeholders and developers understand them.

   
   Example: Writing a user story: “As a customer, I want to track my order in real-time so that I know when my food will arrive.”

* Requirement Analysis and Modeling
   Breaking down and structuring requirements to remove conflicts, fill gaps, and make them ready for design & development.

   Activities:
   * Classifying requirements (functional vs non-functional)
   * Prioritizing requirements (must-have vs nice-to-have)
   * Creating models to visualize requirements:
   * Use Case diagrams
   * Activity diagrams
   * Process flows
   * Wireframes/prototypes

   Example: Drawing a Use Case diagram showing Customer → Place Order → Restaurant → Confirm Order.

* Requirement Validation
   Ensuring that the documented requirements are correct, complete, and aligned with what stakeholders actually want.
   
   Methods:
   * Requirement review meetings with stakeholders
   * Walkthroughs and inspections
   * Prototyping and user feedback sessions
   * Checking requirements against business objectives

   Example: Showing a prototype of the food delivery tracking feature to customers and confirming: “Yes, this meets my needs.”
