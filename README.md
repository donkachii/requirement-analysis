# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

A requirement analysis is a phase about what a system should do, or how it should behave, in order to satisfy a need.

Think of requirements as the bridge between stakeholders (people who need the system) and developers (people who build the system).

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

	•	They prevent misunderstanding between developers and stakeholders.
	•	They save time and cost by reducing rework.
	•	They ensure the final product actually solves the problem.
